  "highschool_achievement": " It was at this school that I was first introduced to programming and where I learned the majority of my foundational algorithms — including graph theory, pathfinding, dynamic programming, searching, and more. This solid groundwork equipped me with strong problem-solving skills in programming, as well as the ability to think creatively when approaching complex challenges. During my time at the school, I actively participated in numerous programming competitions and was honored with various awards and medals. Notable achievements among others include:",

  "university_achievement_1": " One of the first questions that may arise when looking at my academic record is why my overall GPA is only at a “good” level rather than “excellent,” especially given my strong foundation in programming from high school. And it’s a fair question.",
  "university_achievement_2": "While I entered university with solid programming skills, I found myself challenged by several general education subjects such as philosophy, physics, economics, and law — areas that are not my strengths. At my university, however, these subjects are mandatory components of the curriculum. As a result, my grades in these courses were often just enough to pass (typically around 5 or 6 out of 10), which significantly affected my overall GPA.",
  "university_achievement_3": "That said, I take great pride in my performance in all programming-related courses, where I consistently scored above 8. Additionally, I achieved high marks in project management, soft skills, and my internship evaluation. These strong performances helped bring my overall GPA up to 7.79.",
  "university_achievement_4": "What I’m most proud of during my four years at university is that my graduation thesis received the highest score (9.4/10) among all student projects that year. More importantly, university was where I honed my abilities and learned how to apply my knowledge to real-world problems — enabling me to create the best possible products I could deliver.",
